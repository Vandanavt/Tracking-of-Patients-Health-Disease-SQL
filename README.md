In our exploration of patients' health and disease data using SQL, we've looked at analyzing, organizing the database better, and making our queries run faster. We've found interesting things in the patient records, made the database work more smoothly, and improved how we ask questions to get answers from the data. This project isn't just about numbers and questions; it's about making things work better, being accurate, and always trying to learn more from the huge amount of healthcare data out there. Here's to finding more interesting stories in the data and seeing how exploring data can really make a difference!

These will be the queris which we will be resolving:
1. Retrieve the Patient_id and ages of all patients. 
2. Select all female patients who are older than 40. 
3. Calculate the average BMI of patients. 
4. List patients in descending order of blood glucose levels. 
5. Find patients who have hypertension and diabetes. 
6. Determine the number of patients with heart disease. 
7. Group patients by smoking history and count how many smokers and non
smokers there are. 
8. Retrieve the Patient_ids of patients who have a BMI greater than the average BMI. 
9. Find the patient with the highest HbA1c level and the patient with the lowest 
HbA1clevel. 
10. Calculate the age of patients in years (assuming the current date as of now). 
11. Rank patients by blood glucose level within each gender group. 
12. Update the smoking history of patients who are older than 50 to "Ex-smoker." 
13. Insert a new patient into the database with sample data. 
14. Delete all patients with heart disease from the database. 
15. Find patients who have hypertension but not diabetes using the EXCEPT operator.

16. Define a unique constraint on the "patient_id" column to ensure its values are unique. 
17. Create a view that displays the Patient_ids, ages, and BMI of patients. 
18. Suggest improvements in the database schema to reduce data redundancy and 
improve data integrity. 
19. Explain how you can optimize the performance of SQL queries on this dataset.
